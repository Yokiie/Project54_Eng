This is an english translation based on the adapted "Project54" ghost from AG36.
This translation was made entirely by Yokiie (myself).
This is a fan translation and I have no ties with AG36 or とわ/Towa

The Ghost「54」's original author is "とわ" (Towa)

Credit to AG36 for  maintaining/reviving the Ghost 「54」which is the version I translated.

This is a quote from the author of this version, AG36 :
"The plan to transplant 54 to Satomi was scraped、
so the 54-derivative ghost made based on the original 54 is now called "54-like (former project 54)"
Please take care of my 54 non-blood sister."

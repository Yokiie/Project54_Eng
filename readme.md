## About this project
This is an english translation based on the adapted "Project54" ghost from AG36.  
Here : https://github.com/ag3601/Project54 .  
This translation was made entirely by Yokiie (myself).  
This is a fan translation and I have no ties with AG36 or とわ/Towa

- **Set frequency of chats —** this will set how often 54 speaks random dialogues.
- **Change my user info —** here you can change what 54 knows about you (your **name**, **birthday**, the **honorifics** like -chan/-kun/-san & your **gender**) some of the dialogues of 54 will change depending on your user data, she can wish you a happy birthday, etc...
- **Selfish mode —** This setting will change some of the dialogues so that 54's dialogues sound more self-centered.
- **Display settings of the uninstall button —** This can activate/deactivate the uninstall button in the right-clic menu so no accidental uninstalls happen. 54 will tell you how happy she is if you deactivate the uninstall button.
- **Settings to close Ghost by head-clicking —** If you click her head enough times, she will get mad & leave (the ghost will close itself). You can enable/disable this feature in here.
- **Reset activity history —** 54 remembers activities & things said to her. You can reset her memory in this menu (**WARNING :** this cannot be undone).
